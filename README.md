# Number Predictor
 
This project utilizes a CNN with two convolution layers and two maxpooling layers. The convolution layers contain 32 and 64 filters respectively. The DNN contains 512 input nodes and uses the activation function "relu". The output layer contains 10 nodes used to represent each digit. The actual GUI is build using Tkinter. The main challenge I came across this project was figuring out how to take convert the current state of the canvas into an image. I have a link within my PredictionGui.py file that links the page I used to help me solve this issue. To use this project, just download it and then run the PredictionGui.py file. If you come across an error, you most likely would need to train the model once more. 
Requirements for this project include: 
Tensorflow 2.0.0
Numpy
tkinter
Open CV
Pillow
